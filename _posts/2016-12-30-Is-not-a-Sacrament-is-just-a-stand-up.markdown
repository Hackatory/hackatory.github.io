Each day, at 12.00 am, the Minister is ready to start the Sacrament. It doesn’t really matter what you did or not the last day or even the quality of the code, the only most important thing is that you be there on the stand-up and talk about something.

Is not a Sin and doesn’t matter the reason. 

Being flexible about meetings helps to generate a good atmosphere in the project, which in consequence helps to keep you motivated and this last adjective believe me that is something that the client is interested in.
